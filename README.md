# EE224-CPU_Project

IITB-CPU is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching purpose. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system, i.e., it can process 16 bits at a 
time. It uses point-to-point communication infrastructure.

The main file contains the Datapath and Controller. The architecture of main contains details about the components, port mapping the finite state machine. It has processes for detecting the clock and for the state transition. Each state's datapath is defined by a set of control signals. 

## Components
